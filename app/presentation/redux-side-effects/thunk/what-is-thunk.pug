    +slide_column(50)
        +code(null, 'javascript')
            include:escape ./pure-js-thunk.js

            :markdown-it
                A thunk is just a function that will return some data or perform an operation when called.

        +code_focus('1-3').current-only
            :markdown-it
                The function takes no arguments - it has access to all data it needs.

        +code_focus('5-7').current-only
            :markdown-it
                Most often the thunk will have access to some params via closure.

        +code_focus('9-14').current-only
            :markdown-it
                The thunk can do anything - synchoronous or not

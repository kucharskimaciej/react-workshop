                    ### Single source of truth

                    The complete state of an application is kept in one place, which ensures no duplication or conflicts.

            +fragment()
                :markdown-it
                    ### Predictable

                    The state can only be changed via events (actions). It makes tracking the changes very easy.

            +fragment()
                :markdown-it
                    ### Immutable

                    The state is represented as an immutable object. Every change creates a new snapshot.
                    This provides solid performance (no need to compare values!) and easy testing.

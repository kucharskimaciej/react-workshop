                The last example could be modified to showcase the bi-directional communication between two components:
                the stateful parent (which keeps the `clickCount` in state) and a stateless child.

        +fragment().current-only
            :markdown-it
                The parent component passes data (`clickCount`) down to it's children using props.

        +fragment().current-only
            :markdown-it
                Alongside the data it also passes a callback (`onClick`) to enable the child to talk back.

        +fragment().current-only
            :markdown-it
                What about components that are not in the parent-child relation?

                    For bigger component hierarchies this method becomes unmanageable.

                :markdown-it
                    The application becomes fragile, it's hard to move components around,
                    and creating a simple interaction requires lots of code.

            +fragment().current-only
                :markdown-it
                    There is also another issue: central components must hold too much state and responsibility.
